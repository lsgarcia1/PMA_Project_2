COSC 4010

May 12, 2020

We started this project by encoding each of the parameters that we had chosen. We decided to use Caesar Cyphers for a majority of our values but we also incorporated some XOR cyphers. The user is given the opportunity to change some of the values and then we change a few preselected parameters to encode. We find the hash in the files to determine if the user has changed a file. If values were changed a message is outputted to the user to inform them that the file was altered and we reset Defaults.txt to the default values. Defaults.txt contains all of our initial encoded parameter values.
